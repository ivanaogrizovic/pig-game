<h1>A pig game made wih JS DOM manipulation.</h1>

A pig game presents, in this case, 2 players.

The objective of the game is to get to 100 by rolling the dice.
Everytime you roll the dice, whatever number yoy get will be added to the score.
If you score "1", your points, howevery, will reset to 0.
You can "hold" onto your score and let the other player play, or roll again if you feel lucky.
